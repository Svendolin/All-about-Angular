# &nbsp;- ALL ABOUT ANGULAR - ✔

This "All about Angular"-repository catches up its focus on all the Projects and Excercises I've made with Angular through the years as a **SAE-Web Development** student with exercise lessons every week as well as tutorial videos on _Youtube_.
        
Direct Link to the place where I'm studying are you going to find [HERE](https://www.sae.edu/che/de?utm_source=PS01&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-4SLBhCVARIsACrhWLVIaD_aUt7y4brT7tqMW9o7tskgb1vjQqJFkzQwkwdN_40_Ls7MgAEaAtXxEALw_wcB)

## Technologies and Installation ✅
***



**Node.js - INSTALLATION:** *(Used for runtime environment for Javascript, script performs directly on the computer and not just on a web browser)*
* https://nodejs.org/en/ (Recommend LTS for an unbuggy / non-risky experience)
<br />



NODEMON - INSTALLATION:
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon 
* (Nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected).

## &nbsp;Angular - Useful Assistance ✅
***
``Angular`` = Javascript Framework

_**WHY SHALL I USE ANGULAR?**_

- Provides components to effectively connect to the server or increase compatibility
- Scripts are already available (safe time) and here to simplify the programming process
- Other well-known Javascript frameworks are React and View
- Provides a variety of libraries (code libraries) -> **Material Design** for graphical components
- Built and used by Google = support is guaranteed



```js
/* ---- Lorem Ipsum ---- */

<script>
